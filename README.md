							a visualisation-oriented interface to data


About **void**
==================

**void** is a minimalistic framework designed to support my PhD research and tool development
for large-scale visualisation and analysis.  Even still, it may be useful to others, with the 
caveat that it should be considered somewhat volatile and expiremental until all areas are 
cleaned up and tested.  Currently, this covers a core toolkit, as well as data and 
graphics interfaces.

Primary development environment is OSX 10.7 Lion, so that's the most tested and stable
at this stage.

There is preliminary support for:

* OSX x86/64
* Linux x86/x86_64
* Window x86/64


Distribution
-------------------

Currently **void** is only available in source form via github:

	* git clone git://github.com/ICRAR/void.git


Documentation
-------------------

* Coming soon.  Lame  -- I know.  Bug me.
