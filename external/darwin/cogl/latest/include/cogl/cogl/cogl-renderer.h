/**
 * SECTION:cogl-renderer
 * @short_description: Choosing a means to render
 *
 * A #CoglRenderer represents a means to render. It encapsulates the
 * selection of an underlying driver, such as OpenGL or OpenGL-ES and
 * a selection of a window system binding API such as GLX, or EGL or
 * WGL.
 *
 * A #CoglRenderer has two states, "unconnected" and "connected". When
 * a renderer is first instantiated using cogl_renderer_new() it is
 * unconnected so that it can be configured and constraints can be
 * specified for how the backend driver and window system should be
 * chosen.
 *
 * After configuration a #CoglRenderer can (optionally) be explicitly
 * connected using cogl_renderer_connect() which allows for the
 * handling of connection errors so that fallback configurations can
 * be tried if necessary. Applications that don't support any
 * fallbacks though can skip using cogl_renderer_connect() and leave
 * Cogl to automatically connect the renderer.
 *
 * Once you have a configured #CoglRenderer it can be used to create a
 * #CoglDisplay object using cogl_display_new().
 *
 * <note>Many applications don't need to explicitly use
 * cogl_renderer_new() or cogl_display_new() and can just jump
 * straight to cogl_context_new() and pass a %NULL display argument so
 * Cogl will automatically connect and setup a renderer and
 * display.</note>

 *
 * While the renderer is unconnected it can be configured so that

 * x11" for example via cogl_renderer_add_criteria().
 *
 * There are also some platform specific configuration apis such
