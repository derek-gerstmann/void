 * @parent_texture: The full texture containing a sub-region you want
 *                  to make a #CoglSubTexture from.
 * @sub_x: The top-left x coordinate of the parent region to make
 *         a texture from.
 * @sub_y: The top-left y coordinate of the parent region to make
 *         a texture from.
 * @sub_width: The width of the parent region to make a texture from.
 * @sub_height: The height of the parent region to make a texture
 *              from.
 *
 * Creates a high-level #CoglSubTexture representing a sub-region of
 * any other #CoglTexture. The sub-region must strictly lye within the
 * bounds of the @parent_texture. The returned texture implements the
 * #CoglMetaTexture interface because it's not a low level texture
 * that hardware can understand natively.
 *
 * <note>Remember: Unless you are using high level drawing APIs such
 * as cogl_rectangle() or other APIs documented to understand the
 * #CoglMetaTexture interface then you need to use the
 * #CoglMetaTexture interface to resolve a #CoglSubTexture into a
 * low-level texture before drawing.</note>
 *
 * Returns: A newly allocated #CoglSubTexture representing a
 *          sub-region of @parent_texture.
