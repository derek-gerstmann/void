/**
 * SECTION:cogl-texture-2d-sliced
 * @short_description: Functions for creating and manipulating 2D meta
 *                     textures that may internally be comprised of
 *                     multiple 2D textures with power-of-two sizes.
 *
 * These functions allow high-level meta textures (See the
 * #CoglMetaTexture interface) to be allocated that may internally be
 * comprised of multiple 2D texture "slices" with power-of-two sizes.
 *
 * This API can be useful when working with GPUs that don't have
 * native support for non-power-of-two textures or if you want to load
 * a texture that is larger than the GPUs maximum texture size limits.
 *
 * The algorithm for slicing works by first trying to map a virtual
 * size to the next larger power-of-two size and then seeing how many
 * wasted pixels that would result in. For example if you have a
 * virtual texture that's 259 texels wide, the next pot size = 512 and
 * the amount of waste would be 253 texels. If the amount of waste is
 * above a max-waste threshold then we would next slice that texture
 * into one that's 256 texels and then looking at how many more texels
 * remain unallocated after that we choose the next power-of-two size.
 * For the example of a 259 texel image that would mean having a 256
 * texel wide texture, leaving 3 texels unallocated so we'd then
 * create a 4 texel wide texture - now there is only one texel of
 * waste. The algorithm continues to slice the right most textures
 * until the amount of waste is less than or equal to a specfied
 * max-waste threshold. The same logic for slicing from left to right
 * is also applied from top to bottom.
