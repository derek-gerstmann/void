/**
 * SECTION:cogl-texture-rectangle
 * @short_description: Functions for creating and manipulating rectangle
 *                     textures for use with non-normalized coordinates.
 *
 * These functions allow low-level "rectangle" textures to be allocated.
 * These textures are never constrained to power-of-two sizes but they
 * also don't support having a mipmap and can only be wrapped with
 * %COGL_PIPELINE_WRAP_MODE_CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
 *
 * The most notable difference between rectangle textures and 2D
 * textures is that rectangle textures are sampled using un-normalized
 * texture coordinates, so instead of using coordinates (0,0) and
 * (1,1) to map to the top-left and bottom right corners of the
 * texture you would instead use (0,0) and (width,height).
 *
 * The use of non-normalized coordinates can be particularly
 * convenient when writing glsl shaders that use a texture as a lookup
 * table since you don't need to upload separate uniforms to map
 * normalized coordinates to texels.
 *
 * If you want to sample from a rectangle texture from GLSL you should
 * use the sampler2DRect sampler type.
 *
 * Applications wanting to use #CoglTextureRectangle should first check
 * for the %COGL_FEATURE_ID_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE feature using
 * cogl_has_feature().
